!!! info "Mechanic Overview"
    The **Titan Spirit** is the ethereal form a Titan takes before manifesting in the corporeal realm or after its physical body has been "defeated". In this state, they are the ultimate predators of the spirit world.

## The Manifestation Cycle

### 1. Seeking a Vessel
Titan Spirits search for a nearby host to make their vessel. They cannot interact with the physical world indefinitely and must find a compatible host:
* **Standard Titans:** Must find and make contact with a **Templar**.
* **Witherzilla:** Requires a **Player** to act as its vessel.

Once contact is made, the Titan officially returns to the corporeal realm and can be harmed as normal.

### 2. Post-Defeat Behavior
When a Titan is defeated, the Spirit leaves the area by ascending into the sky:
* **The Ascension:** Upon reaching **Y 256**, it teleports into a very far away chunk.
* **The Stalker:** Alternatively, it can return to vengefully kill the player or stalk them until a compatible Templar shows up.

## ⚠️ Survival Warning
Because Spirits can relocate and reappear, you might encounter the **same Titan** you had fought and killed several times. 

!!! danger "Base Longevity"
    Don't trust in your base's longevity, because it has none. If a Titan Spirit follows you home and finds a vessel, no structure can protect you from its return.
