# The Titans

* Titans are God-like entities that exist outside our reality, coming in only to have lots of fun. Some few Titans come in for conquest, but most are just messing around, or search for reasons to flatten stuff (ie: bats and squids). Most of them spawn naturally are usually resting and waiting, only awakening when a player disturbs them.

* All Titans have the ability to spawn smaller versions of themselves, with some Titans even having Loyalists, Priests, Zealots and Templars. [Witherzilla](witherzilla.md) spawns his minions from his head (literally), as does the Snow and Iron Golem titans, the Ender Colossus makes his teleport in, the Blaze Titan forges his from his body, and the rest raise their minions from the ground, no matter what the material. Some have their own *special* minions, too.
* Titans have multiple ways of spawning into the world. The most common way is natural spawning, which works like structure generation, and thus, this method is always reliable, but finite. The second method is a Templar turning into a Titan through contact with the ethereal plain with their supernatural powers. The third is if a Titan Spirit takes over a Templar, which any Titan Spirit will attempt. The final method is through growth serum, which is player managed.

## Titans also have a last resort ability they all can use.
* When and if they feel they've got the right opportunity, they will start a "Re-growth" process where the Titan will start to shrink until it's the size of its normal counterpart, at which point it begins to grow again.This resets the Titan's entire health pool, meaning you'll have to start from scratch. The trick to preventing this is to kill the Titan quickly!

## Things relating to all Titans:
* They don't despawn (like Ender Dragons)
* They have a damage cap of 1000 (500 on Nightmare), and have a hurt cooldown of 1.5 seconds
* They are immune to most damage
* Their numbers are limited to your loaded chunks, unless spawned through other means
* Titans can't despawn on peaceful, aren't affected by the butcher command, and are immune to instant kill methods
* They can and will divide you by zero
* You must hit their hitbox base (bug with Minecraft in general), unless using projectiles
* Their attacks destroy armor of all types
* They'll deal damage to you even if you have super armor, resistance V or creative mode
* They're all immune to fire and lava, and sink in all liquids, but can't drown
* Non-armor piercing attacks do very little damage to them due to their abnormally high armor ratings (21 for Lesser Titans, 22 for Average, 23 for Greater, 24 for God)
* If Titans are attacked by something that does less than 20 damage, they aren't affected by it at all.
* Titans react to being hit by anything (even creative mode players), and it can be very hard to loose them
* When it comes to doing battles, Titans have the attention span of a fly if anything they normally auto attack is in their line of sight
* Titan on Titan fights are awesome to watch, especially on the Mob battle version due to the minions having mini battles all around them
* Break the 4th wall

* Titans are the only mobs in minecraft that are truly invulnerable. Yes, they can be killed, but upon disappearing, the REAL titan goes flying away into the sky. This is the fabled [TITAN SPIRIT!](titan_spirit.md)
