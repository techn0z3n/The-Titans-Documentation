* **Bug Note:** In some early pre-builds of 0.49, a bug could cause the Omegafish to remain permanently invulnerable if it was hit while transitioning into a burrow.

## Minions:
The Omegafish is never alone. It will constantly summon its minions:
* **Silverfish Loyalists:** Basic fodder. Attacks everything their particular Titan would attack, even if the Titan isn't visibly there.
* **Silverfish Priests:** Support units. Heal nearby injured allies.
* **Silverfish Zealots:** Aggressive attackers. Capable of performing super-human feats such as sprinting really fast, jumping higher than normal, taking more injures than it's possible to sustain, and killing entities many times bigger than themselves.
* **Silverfish Bishop:** They bring down judgement from the heavens onto the enemies of their titan.
* **Silverfish Templar:** Tanky defenders. The most complicated and powerful of the five types. They are capable of levitation, are immune to fire and poison, and have extremely high resistance to magic damage. They also alternate between their normal mode of attack, and special random ranged attacks. Their is a list for all of these random attacks for each Templar linked [here](../minions/templar_attacks.md)

## 🎒 Strategy & Loot

### How to Defeat
1. **The Stun:** You cannot melee it safely at first. Use [Harcadium Arrows](../items/harcadium_arrow.md) to chip away at it.
2. **The Flop:** Once it sustains enough damage, it will "flop" over, becoming stunned.
3. **The Finishing Move:** This is your chance to use your titan-slaying tools for maximum damage. Keep in mind it won't stay stunned forever

### Taming the Beast
Unlike Witherzilla, the Omegafish can be subdued. 
1. Stun the Omegafish.
2. Right-click with a **Golden Apple**.
3. If successful, you can mount and control this Titan.

### Notable Drops
* **All things Silverfish Related:** Stone, Silverfish Blocks, and Books.
* **Harcadium Nuggets:** Rare chance to drop materials for mid-tier gear.

!!! danger "Equipment Check"
    Do **not** fight this Titan in Diamond Armor. Even as the "weakest" Titan, its Body Slam (500 damage) will ignore most vanilla protections. You MUST use Harcadium as it is the minimum requirement of fighting all Titans
