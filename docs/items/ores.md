# Ores & Elements

This section covers the various natural elements and alloys found in the world of The Titans. While some are common, others are essential for progressing toward Titan-slaying gear.

---

## Copper Ore

Copper is the most abundant element added by the mod. While it is technically "weak," its value lies in its availability and its role in creating **Bronze**.

### 📊 Mining Statistics
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Average Vein Size** | 24 Blocks |
| **Max Height** | Y 256 |
| **Rarity** | Extremely Common (More common than Coal) |

### 🛠️ Usage
* **Early Game:** Can be used to craft basic Copper tools and armor. 
* **Tier Level:** Roughly equivalent to **Wood** in terms of durability.
* **Alloying:** Combine Copper with **Tin** to create **Bronze**, which is significantly more durable.

!!! info "Evaluation"
    Copper is pretty useless on its own once you progress past the first few minutes of gameplay. Its primary purpose is to be farmed in bulk for industrial alloys.

---

## 🛠️ Metallurgy
To advance your gear, use the following recipe logic:
* **Copper + Tin = Bronze**

---

## Tin Ore

Tin serves as the second "Beginner Ore" in the progression tree. While slightly more durable than Copper, it is best utilized when smelted into stronger alloys.

### 📊 Mining Statistics
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Average Vein Size** | 16 Blocks |
| **Max Height** | Y 256 |
| **Rarity** | Very Common (Found everywhere) |

### 🛠️ Usage
* **Early Game:** Can be crafted into Tin tools and armor.
* **Tier Level:** Offers slightly better durability than Copper, but still considered a "starter" tier.
* **Primary Use:** Better used to create **Bronze** equipment rather than being used on its own.

!!! info "Evaluation"
    Like Copper, Tin is pretty useless on its own for long-term survival. Its true value is unlocked once you begin the alloying process.

## Bronze (Alloy)

Bronze is the first major upgrade for any player. It is highly valued in the early game because it is significantly more plentiful than Iron while providing superior performance to basic stone or early-game elements.

</p>

### ⚒️ Production Statistics
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Crafting Recipe** | 1x Copper Ingot + 1x Tin Ingot |
| **Plentitude** | More common than Iron (due to abundance of components) |
| **Utility** | Excellent early-game material |

### 🛠️ Usage
* **Superior Durability:** Bronze has more durability than Copper and Tin combined.
* **Tier Level:** Acts as a direct upgrade to Stone tools, but with much better efficiency and longevity.
* **Equipment:** Can be crafted into a full suite of Bronze tools and armor.

!!! success "The Perfect Starter Alloy"
    Bronze is really cool due to how you make it. It is an all-around better material than its components, allowing players to establish a solid gear set before diving into deeper mining expeditions.

## 💎 Chromium & Magnesium

Chromium and Magnesium are specialized ores that introduce players to advanced metallurgy. Unlike earlier ores, these two are physically interdependent; one is essentially useless without the other.

<p align="center">

  <em>"Cool, shiny, but currently unusable."</em>
</p>

### 📊 Mining Statistics
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Average Vein Size** | 8 Blocks |
| **Max Height** | Y 48 (Requires deeper mining) |
| **Interdependency** | High (Requires both to be of any use) |

### 🛠️ Usage
* **The Shiny Ingot Phase:** On their own, Chromium and Magnesium can't do anything but sit in your inventory as "cool, shiny ingots."
* **Advanced Alloying:** These two elements are the mandatory ingredients required to create **Steel**.

!!! warning "Interdependence"
    Don't bother mining one without the other. You need both Chromium and Magnesium in equal measure to progress into the Steel age of equipment.

## 🏗️ Steel (Alloy)

Steel represents the transition into mid-to-late game power. It is an industrial-grade alloy that provides Diamond-tier protection and efficiency while being far more plentiful to produce.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/items/steel_ingot.png" width="150">
</p>

### ⚒️ Production Statistics
| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Crafting Recipe** | 1x Chromium + 1x Magnesium + 1x Iron + 1x Coal |
| **Plentitude** | More plentiful than Diamond |
| **Tier Level** | Diamond Grade (Mid-to-Late Game) |

### 🛠️ Usage
* **Toughness:** Modeled after real-world structural steel used in buildings and cars, this material is incredibly durable.
* **Diamond Alternative:** Steel can be used to craft tools and armor equivalent to Diamond grade in strength and mining level.
* **The Trade-off:** While just as strong, Steel has slightly lower durability than Diamond:
    * **Tools:** -400 Durability compared to Diamond.
    * **Armor:** -80 Durability compared to Diamond.

!!! success "The Architect's Choice"
    Steel is good for a reason. It is the go-to material for players who want Diamond-level power without the rarity of hunting for actual Diamonds.

## 🧊 Miscellaneous Elements (Unused)

The following ores generate in the world but currently serve no functional purpose in version 0.495. They are primarily for collection or potential future compatibility.

| Ore | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lead** | No current use |
| **Silver** | No current use |
| **Platinum** | No current use |

!!! info "Collector's Note"
    While these "don't have any use yet," it is often wise to hoard them in chests in case of future updates or cross-mod integration.

---

## 🌌 Harcadium (Element No. 753)

Harcadium is the cornerstone of *The Titans* mod. Known as the element that comprises the core of Ender Pearls, it is the only material capable of withstanding the raw power of a Titan.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/items/harcadium_ore.png" width="200">
  <br>
  <em>"The Essence of the End"</em>
</p>

### 📍 Location & Acquisition
Harcadium can be obtained through mining or as a reward for high-level combat:

* **The Overworld:** Found at **Layer 14** or lower. Generates in small veins of 1–4 blocks.
* **The End:** Found in much greater density, appearing with frequency similar to Iron.
* **The Nowhere:** The primary source of the element; the ground is literally littered with it.
* **Titan Drops:** Slain Titans drop Harcadium in varying quantities. The stronger the Titan, the greater the drop.

---

### 📦 Material Forms
Harcadium exists in five condensed forms, allowing for versatile crafting and storage:

| Form | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Block** | Compact storage and structural use. |
| **Item (Ingot)** | The standard crafting component for tools and armor. |
| **Nugget** | Smaller denomination of Harcadium. |
| **Wafer** | Specialized industrial form. |
| **Waflet** | High-utility item. A ring of Waflets in a crafting table yields **64 Ender Pearls**. |

---

### ⚔️ Combat Utility
Harcadium is not just a material; it is a necessity for survival in version 0.495.

* **Anti-Titan Equipment:** Used to craft the first tier of tools and armor capable of damaging Titans and resisting their unique damage types.
* **Minimum Requirement:** As noted in earlier guides, Harcadium is the **baseline** for engaging any Titan in combat.

!!! danger "Worthiness Note"
    While Harcadium gear is powerful, it is merely the gateway to the [Ultima Blade](../items/ultima_blade.md). Master this element before attempting to move higher.

## 🌑 Void Essence

> *"Protection over your physical body in exchange for your soul."*

Void Essence is a tier above Harcadium, offering near-absolute protection at the cost of extreme volatility. It is the material of choice for those hunting Greater Titans and above.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/items/void_ore.png" width="200">
  <br>
  <em>"A volatile fragment of the abyss."</em>
</p>

### ⚠️ Hazardous Properties
The Void does not want to be contained. Handling this ore is a life-threatening task:
* **The Ore Block:** Standing on a raw Void Ore block will kill the player instantly.
* **Mining Detonation:** Breaking the ore causes a violent explosion immediately upon being mined.
* **The Condensed Block:** Once crafted into a block, it will explode anything—mobs or players—that touches it.

---

### 📍 Location & Acquisition
Because of its rarity and danger, searching the Overworld is largely considered a waste of time.

| Location | Density & Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Overworld** | Layer 8 or lower. Generates in 0–2 blocks. Extremely rare. |
| **The End** | Much greater density, appearing roughly as often as Diamond. |
| **The Nowhere** | Relatively plentiful throughout the dimension. |
| **Titan Drops** | Only dropped by the **strongest Titans** in the mod. |

---

### ⚔️ Equipment Potential
Void Essence is used to craft tools and armor that are **stronger than Harcadium in every way**.

* **Elite Anti-Titan Gear:** Higher damage ceilings and superior damage reduction compared to Harcadium.
* **Soul Exchange:** While it provides nearly unrivaled physical protection, the lore implies a heavy spiritual cost for the user.

!!! danger "Safety Protocol"
    When mining Void Essence, ensure you have a high level of Blast Resistance or use long-range mining tools. One misplaced click can result in immediate death and loss of items.
