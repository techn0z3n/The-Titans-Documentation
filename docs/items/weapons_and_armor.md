# Adminium Armor: The Armor of the Gods

> "If who ever wear this armor, if they be worthy, shall possess the power of the gods!"

Adminium is the absolute pinnacle of technology in *The Titans*. It is not crafted from mere stone, but from the fundamental bedrock of the universe itself. This is the only armor set in existence capable of withstanding **Witherzilla's** wrath.

---

## 🏗️ The Cost of Divinity
Crafting this set is a monumental task. It does not use standard Bedrock, but **Compacted Bedrock**.

* **Compacted Bedrock:** Requires 9x Bedrock blocks to craft a single unit.
* **The "Price Tag":** Since you need full suits and tools, the total Bedrock requirement is non-tupilled. You have a lot of Titan slaying ahead of you to gather this much material.
* **Durability:** Practically unbreakable.

---

## ⚡ God-Like Attributes
Equipping the Adminium set transcends the limits of a player, granting abilities usually reserved for the Titans themselves.

### Individual Piece Buffs
* **Helmet:** Night Vision, Water Breathing.
* **Chestplate:** Haste 100, Resistance IV, Strength 50, Fire Resistance.
* **Leggings:** Regeneration 200.
* **Boots:** Jump Boost XV, Speed XV.

### 🌌 Full Set: Divine Presence
When the full set is equipped, your very presence becomes a weapon:
* **Massive Health:** Your health pool expands from 10 hearts to a staggering **410 hearts** ($820 \text{ HP}$).
* **The Killing Aura:** Automatically kills every non-allied entity within a **16-block radius**.
* **Titan Traversal:** Jumping causes a Titan-like **Earthquake**. If `mobGriefing` is enabled, you will literally drill a hole through the Earth.
* **Regeneration:** Includes **Absorption 100** (replenishes every 40s), **Healing X**, and **Saturation 100**.
* **The Hum:** Gives off a very noticeable, loud hum that signals your arrival.

---

## ⚒️ Adminium Tools
Adminium tools represent the ultimate tier of utility and damage.
* **Construction:** Crafted using regular **Bedrock** for the hilts and **Compacted Bedrock** for the main components.

---

!!! danger "Witherzilla Protocol"
    Adminium Armor is the **absolute minimum requirement** to engage Witherzilla. Any other armor—including the Absence set—will be shredded by the God of Titans in seconds.

# 🗡️ The Ultima Blade

> "The largest weapon to ever be wielded by a mortal, this puppy is sentient in its own right."

The **Ultima Blade** is not just a tool; it is a sentient entity that judges its wielder. It is the only weapon capable of striking down the highest-tier Titans, though it comes with a personality of its own.

  <em>"If you are worthy, you shall be a God. If not, you are nothing."</em>
</p>

## ⚡ Divine Statistics

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Attack Damage** | **100,000** |
| **Durability** | **Infinite** (Indestructible) |
| **Reach** | Significantly extended range |
| **Special** | Ignores all forms of damage restrictions and armor |

---

## 🧠 Sentience & Mechanics

The Blade is "smart" and actively protects its wielder—provided they are worthy.

* **Soul Bind:** Upon hitting your first entity with the Blade, the game rule `keepInventory` is automatically set to **true**. The Blade ensures you will never lose it.
* **The Judgment:** The Blade judges its user. If you are found unworthy, it may refuse to function or even judge you for your actions in Creative Mode.
* **The "Kill" Logic:** While it deals 100,000 damage, some Titans have specific stun requirements or "Spirit" mechanics that prevent a one-shot kill. **Read the Titan profiles carefully**.

---

## 🔍 Right-Click Abilities
The Blade acts as a sensory organ for the player, allowing you to detect hidden objects in the world:

* **Ore Detection (Right-Click):** Scans the nearby area for valuable ores and announces their location.
* **Mob Tracking (Shift + Right-Click):** Detects nearby hidden monsters and entities.

---

## ❓ How to Obtain
The Ultima Blade **cannot be crafted**. 

!!! quote "The Creator's Secret"
    "I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out how you get this in survival. That's something for you to figure out. Until then, have plenty of fun with it in creative (if you're worthy for even that)."

---

!!! danger "Worthiness Check"
    In version 0.495, a new system was added that checks the player's "Worthiness." If you attempt to use the blade and fail the check, it will not perform its God-slaying duties.
