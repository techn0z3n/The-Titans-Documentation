!!! danger "Extreme Difficulty"
    As the name implies, **Nightmare Mode** makes life in Minecraft significantly harder. This mode is designed only for players who have mastered the base mechanics of The Titans mod.

!!! warning "Survival Tip"
    Attempting Nightmare Mode without a full set of **Adminium Armor** or better is almost certain suicide. Ensure your world is backed up before enabling this setting, as the increased explosion size can cause severe world griefing.
